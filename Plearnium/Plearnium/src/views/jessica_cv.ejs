                Data Structures and Algorithms Course:
            </div> 
            developed a series of small projects using different data structures and searching/sorting algorithms in C++. 
            In this course we implemented our own data structures, so I was able to understand on a deeper level how
            Doubly Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees, among other data structures, work.

                Computational Modeling of Electrical Systems Course:
            </div> 
            developed with fellow classmates a model for the behaviour of an electric dipole under certain conditions set by 
            the user using MATLAB and MATLAB's App Designer.

                Informatics Course:
            </div>
            (2018-2019) developed a simulation of traffic lights ar a crosswalk in Arduino.

            Every Saturday I teach a middle school student about technology. The topics vary between programming, 
            Artificial Intelligence, developing a webpage using WIX, etc.

                 Golf scorecard project:
            </div>
            I've been working on an a project that resembles a golf scorecard, and it will enable the user to make bets
            with other players while keeping score of their game. I've been taking a Swift 5 course in Coursera since I
            plan on developing it in Swift/SwiftUI.

                HackMTY 2020:
            </div> 
            Three friend and I participated in ACM's Hackathon. The problem we tried to solve regarded the
            situation many businesses in Mexico and around the world are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. What we did
            was a Space Planner app, a challenge by the company Blue Yonder.
